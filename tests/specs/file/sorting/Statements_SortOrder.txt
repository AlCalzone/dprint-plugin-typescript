== should sort groups of many kinds of statements ==
// testing
import "./a";
import "../a";
import "../../b";
import "b";
import "a";
import "../../a";
import "../../a/b";
export * from "c";
export * from "a";

== should keep comments on same line as part of the node ==
// testing
/* a */ import "./a"; /* a */ // a
/* b */ import "b"; /* b */ // b

[expect]
// testing
/* b */ import "b"; /* b */ // b
/* a */ import "./a"; /* a */ // a

== should allow placing a comment to break up the sorting ==
// group 1
import "n";
import "m";
// group 2
import "b";
import "a";

[expect]
// group 1
import "m";
import "n";
// group 2
import "a";

== should keep leading comment block on separate line ==
/**
 * testing
 */
import * as test from "b";
import * as test from "a";

[expect]
/**
 * testing
 */
import * as test from "a";
import * as test from "b";

== should handle comments in between on different lines ==
import { a } from "test";

/* barrel:ignore */
import { a } from "test";

// other

import { a } from "test";

[expect]
import { a } from "test";

/* barrel:ignore */
import { a } from "test";

// other

import { a } from "test";

== should put folders above files ==
import * as t from "https://deno.land/x/a.ts";
import * as u from "https://deno.land/x/sub-dir/a.ts";
import * as u from "https://deno.land/x/sub-dir/other/a.ts";
